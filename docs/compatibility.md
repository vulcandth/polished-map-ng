# Compatibility evidence

Status: initial implementation in progress. Neither upstream parity gate passed.

| Area | Reference | State / required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Binary maps / dimensions | master map.cpp, map.h | Exact byte I/O, New Map, Save As/ASM conversion, filename/explicit/metadata dimensions tested; oversized-file consent pending |
| Paint, fill, replace, swap, history | master main-window.cpp, map.cpp | Core and GUI drag→undo→redo→save tests; all nine resize anchors, zero fill, truncation and history clearing tested; resize event shifts and full gesture matrix pending |
| 2bpp / LZ / CHR / PNG | master tiled-image.cpp, parse-asm.cpp | Initial codecs; all 65,536 bitplane pairs match compiled upstream function; full-codec differential tests pending |
| Metatiles, palettes, collisions | master metatileset.cpp, tileset.cpp, palette-map.cpp, colors.cpp | Binary metatiles, tilepal, six sets, project/special palette precedence, metadata selection, roof colors, compound composition and nine-tile roof replacement tested; collisions and palette editing pending |
| Project discovery / metadata | master config.cpp, option-dialogs.cpp | Makefile root, dimensions/header precedence, legacy macro ordering, numbered aliases and compound companion paths tested; shared-map options, compound selection ordering and complete option selectors need further coverage |
| Main window geometry | master main-window.cpp | Derived rectangle/hit-test/DPI tests pass; light/dark development snapshots inspected; native fonts/themes/rulers and initial scroll positioning pending |
| Block/tileset/roof/palette editors | master *-window.cpp | Pending |
| Events / warp navigation | master event.cpp, map-events.cpp | Pending |
| Preferences, overlays, print/clipboard | master main-window.cpp | Pending |
| Expanded tile/attribute profile | plusplus tile.cpp, metatileset.cpp | Pending; compatible Polished Crystal test required |
| Unified profile detection | both config.cpp variants | Pending |
| Stable automation / batch recovery | new API | Pending |
| Native packaging and runtime | all three OSes | Pending |

New tests must distinguish synthetic vectors, source-derived expectations, and
actual C++ differential observations. A source-derived vector is not a run of
the original application. Unverified assets never become redistributable fixtures.

## Current evidence (2026-10-27)

- Windows local workspace tests, Clippy and rustdoc passed during foundation work.
- `tools/reference_oracle.py` extracts the original conversion function from Git,
  and all default palette constants without modifying them; compiler invocation and generated provenance are retained
  locally. `tests/reference.rs` exhaustively compares its output. CI has a dedicated
  reference job; the default test command explicitly reports this test as ignored.
- Headless GUI tests exercise toolbar state, accessible open options, a complete
  paint/undo/redo/save flow, New Map, resize accept/cancel, and source-derived geometry. Optional visual tests:
  `cargo test -p polished-map-gui --features visual-tests`.
- CLI rendered the unmodified upstream master Kanto example at 5760×4320. The PNG
  was visually inspected locally; this is a smoke test, not a pixel differential.
  Neither the game assets nor resulting PNG are included in the repository.
- Dependency license/source/advisory checks pass with the explicit maintenance
  exceptions in `docs/dependencies.md`; duplicate versions remain warnings.
- Initial foundation CI passed on Windows, Linux and macOS, including MSRV 1.95,
  Linux snapshots, dependency policy and the C++ bitplane oracle. This verifies
  builds/headless tests, not native platform interaction. No packaged release.
- Pinned pokecrystal fixture `bd983395006298e976ae1871ef092e87f3385506`:
  236 map files discover/open/render across 35 tilesets; 18 shared block files need
  explicit dimensions/tileset from an owning map. The real-project test checks all
  254 top-level .blk files without modifying them. New Bark Town's unannotated
  render was inspected, including project palette and roof colors. All 236 maps
  with named metadata also render with project palettes. Full pixel parity remains
  pending. All default palette channels match the compiled upstream color table.
- Compound graphics tests cover full/base path precedence, optional companions,
  malformed companion errors, 16-tile row padding, palette indices, both slot
  layouts and the original first-256-slot limit. Roof tests cover slots 0x0a–0x12,
  exact nine-tile validation and padded LZ rejection. These are source-derived
  vectors, not compiled C++ composition comparisons. CLI PNG output and GUI
  option entry exercise the same compositor. All five roofs in pinned pokecrystal
  load; New Bark matches the base johto graphics and the four alternatives change
  the rendered roof. Graphics sources remain unmodified.
- Native Windows smoke test: launched the built eframe app; opened NewBarkTown
  through the Windows picker; checked inferred dimensions/tileset; saved a copy
  through Ctrl+Shift+S; observed the native overwrite prompt; declined replacement
  and canceled Save As; closed the app. Copy and source SHA-256 both remained
  `41a1012a051d22ade1b6cdb14577c4b6ad3e195be7024d6f3a020a9f7f5fedd3`.
  The pinned reference checkout remained clean. This does not verify DPI changes,
  clipboard, child viewports, or Linux/macOS native dialogs.
